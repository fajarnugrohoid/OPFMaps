    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=7D:7D:4B:68:03:37:55:51:C9:52:51:3C:80:42:D1:A6:20:0C:AF:66%3Borg.onepf.maps.testapp

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    7D:7D:4B:68:03:37:55:51:C9:52:51:3C:80:42:D1:A6:20:0C:AF:66;org.onepf.maps.testapp

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">
        YOUR_KEY_HERE
    </string>
</resources>
